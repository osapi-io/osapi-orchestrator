# AGENTS.md

Test: `just test` | Before committing: `just ready`

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first. It covers prerequisites, setup,
package structure, code standards, testing, and how to add an operation. All of
it applies to agents exactly as they apply to people. This file carries only
what is specific to agents.

## Running tools

Invoke tools through `mise`, not from your path:

```bash
mise exec -- just test
```

`mise` is active in a person's shell and supplies the versions `.mise.toml`
declares. An agent's shell has no activation, so a bare `just` resolves to
whatever is installed globally, usually an older version.

The symptom is a check that fails here and passes in continuous integration, on
a file nobody edited. When that happens, establish which version ran before
treating the failure as real.

## Where the rules come from

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#before-you-start) names the specification.
When a convention here and the specification disagree, the specification wins.
Say so rather than following the code.

## Task tracking

**Design happens in the design docs.** Write or change the page in
[osapi-io/specs](https://github.com/osapi-io/specs) before building, and correct
it where building proves it wrong. A design document kept in this repository
goes stale the moment the code moves past it, and nothing catches the drift.
