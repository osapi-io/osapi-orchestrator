# AGENTS.md

Test: `just test` | Before committing: `just ready`

Read @CONTRIBUTING.md first. It covers prerequisites, setup, package structure,
code standards, testing, and how to add an operation. All of it applies to
agents exactly as they apply to people. This file carries only what is specific
to agents.

## Running tools

Invoke tools through `mise`, not from your path:

```bash
mise exec -- just test
```

`mise` is active in a person's shell and supplies the versions `.mise.toml`
declares. An agent's shell has no activation, so a bare `just` resolves to
whatever is installed globally, usually an older version.

The symptom is a check that fails here and passes in continuous integration, on
a file nobody edited. When that happens, establish which version ran before
treating the failure as real.

## Where the rules come from

@CONTRIBUTING.md names the specification under "Before you start". When a
convention here and the specification disagree, the specification wins. Say so
rather than following the code.

## Task tracking

**Do not use superpowers.** Spec Kit governs specification, planning, and
implementation, and the design record for a change lives in
[osapi-io/specs](https://github.com/osapi-io/specs). A second workflow over that
ground gives two answers to which artifact is authoritative, and the answer that
loses is the one nobody reads. Nothing superpowers produces is committed.
